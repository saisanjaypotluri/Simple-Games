# Simple-Games
This repository consit of simple games such as guessing a number, sudoku, etc.,

Since there are multiple games, I did not stick to any one convetional language, but rather used various languages such as C, Java, python, etc., Few of these games are made of simple logics while other required more brain stroming for coding.
